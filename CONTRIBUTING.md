## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Fork and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/gh-workflow-issue-creator.git
cd gh-workflow-issue-creator

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/your-org/gh-workflow-issue-creator.git

# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Start development
npm run dev          # Watch mode for TypeScript
npm test -- --watch  # Watch mode for tests
```

### Before Submitting

```bash
# Run all checks
npm run check  # Runs lint + test

# Individual checks
npm run lint   # ESLint
npm test       # Vitest with coverage (must stay 100%)
npm run build  # Bundle with ncc

# Format code
npm run format
```

## üìã Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer functional programming where sensible
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing
- **100% coverage is required** - no exceptions
- Write tests before or alongside code
- Mock external dependencies (GitHub API, file system)
- Test both happy and error paths
- Use descriptive test names that explain the "why"

### Commits
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Test additions or fixes
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add terraform category template
fix: handle rate limit errors gracefully
docs: clarify PAT permissions needed
test: add edge cases for fingerprint generation
```

### Pull Requests
- **Keep PRs focused** - one feature/fix per PR
- **Size matters** - aim for <500 lines changed
- **Description** - explain the why, not just the what
- **Screenshots** - include for visual changes
- **Link issues** - use "Fixes #123" in description
- **Update docs** - if adding features or changing behavior

#### PR Template
```markdown
## Problem
Brief description of what problem this solves

## Solution
How this PR addresses the problem

## Testing
How you tested these changes

## Checklist
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Coverage remains 100%
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

1. **Discuss First** (for major changes)
   - Open an issue or discussion
   - Get feedback on approach
   - Prevents wasted effort

2. **Branch Strategy**
   - Branch from `main`
   - Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`
   - Keep branches up-to-date with upstream

3. **Test Driven Development**
   - Write failing test
   - Write minimal code to pass
   - Refactor and repeat

4. **Code Review Process**
   - All code needs review
   - Address feedback constructively
   - Reviews usually within 48 hours
