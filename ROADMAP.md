## 🎯 Vision

Create the most reliable and developer-friendly GitHub Action for turning CI/CD failures into actionable issues, with smart deduplication and templates that work for both humans and AI agents.

## 📍 Current Status: Pre-Alpha - Not Yet Functional

**Reality Check**: The source code exists but the project hasn't been built or set up. We need to complete basic setup before any features can be tested or used.

## 🚀 Development Phases

### 🚧 Phase 0: Foundation (IN PROGRESS - BLOCKED)
**Current Blockers:**
- [ ] No package-lock.json - dependencies never installed
- [ ] No dist/ directory - project never built
- [ ] Tests cannot run - missing dependencies
- [ ] Cannot be used as GitHub Action - missing distribution

**What's Actually Done:**
- [x] Source code written
- [x] Test files created (minimal)
- [x] Templates created
- [x] Examples provided
- [x] Configuration defined

**What's Needed:**
- [ ] Run `npm install` to create package-lock.json
- [ ] Run `npm test` to verify tests work
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create dist/
- [ ] Test in actual GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Fix any discovered issues

### ❌ Phase 1: MVP Release (NOT STARTED)
**Cannot begin until Phase 0 is complete**

**Planned for this phase:**
- [ ] Verify fingerprint generation works
- [ ] Test issue creation/update
- [ ] Validate close-on-success mode
- [ ] Test cross-repository features
- [ ] Create first working release tag

### 📋 Phase 2: Enhanced Intelligence (FUTURE)
**Target: After Phase 1 complete**
- [ ] Smart log extraction with context
- [ ] Log redaction for sensitive data
- [ ] Category-specific error parsing
- [ ] Improved error pattern recognition
- [ ] Performance metrics in issues
- [ ] Better handling of matrix job failures

### 🔧 Phase 3: Developer Experience (FUTURE)
**Target: After Phase 2**
- [ ] GitHub App authentication support
- [ ] Interactive configuration wizard
- [ ] VS Code extension for template editing
- [ ] Template validation CLI tool
- [ ] Migration tool from other issue creators
- [ ] Detailed troubleshooting guide

### 🌟 Phase 4: Customization Power (FUTURE)
**Target: After Phase 3**
- [ ] Pluggable template system
- [ ] Custom partials and helpers
- [ ] Template marketplace/registry
- [ ] YAML-based template definitions
- [ ] Runtime template selection logic
- [ ] Template inheritance and composition

### 🚀 Phase 5: Advanced Features (FUTURE)
**Target: After Phase 4**
- [ ] AI-powered root cause analysis
- [ ] Suggested fixes based on patterns
- [ ] Integration with error tracking services
- [ ] Workflow failure trends dashboard
- [ ] Slack/Teams/Discord notifications
- [ ] Automatic PR creation for known fixes

## 🔥 Immediate Actions Required

Before ANY roadmap items can proceed:

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install  # Creates package-lock.json
   ```

2. **Verify Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test  # See if tests actually pass
   ```

3. **Build Project**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # Creates dist/ directory
   ```

4. **Make First Commit**
   - Commit package-lock.json
   - Commit dist/ directory
   - Tag as v0.0.1-alpha

## 💡 Current State vs. Claims

### What Documentation Said
- "Phase 0: Foundation (Complete)" ❌
- "Phase 1: MVP Release (Complete - v1.0.0)" ❌
- "We've successfully launched v1.0.0" ❌

### Actual Reality
- Phase 0: ~70% complete (missing build/setup)
- Phase 1: 0% complete (cannot start)
- Version: No releases, not even alpha
- Status: Source code only, not runnable

## 📊 Success Metrics (Once Functional)

When we actually have a working action, we'll measure:
- **Adoption**: Active installations and usage
- **Reliability**: Uptime and successful issue creation rate
- **Performance**: Action execution time
- **Community**: Contributors and engagement
- **Impact**: Time saved debugging CI/CD failures

## 🤝 Get Involved

### How to Help RIGHT NOW

1. **Setup & Build**: Help get the project building
2. **Test**: Try to run tests and document failures
3. **Fix**: Resolve any build or test issues
4. **Document**: Update docs as you discover issues

### Future Contributions (After It Works)

- 🧪 **Testing**: Real-world workflow scenarios
- 📝 **Templates**: Industry-specific categories
- 🌍 **Localization**: Multi-language support
- 📚 **Documentation**: Tutorials and examples
- 🔍 **Research**: Failure pattern analysis

## 📅 Realistic Timeline

### Next 24 Hours
- Get someone to run `npm install`
- Attempt to build with `npm run build`
- Document any errors encountered

### Next Week
- Fix build/test issues
- Create first alpha release
- Test in real GitHub Actions

### Next Month
- Stabilize core features
- Gather feedback from early users
- Plan v0.1.0 release

### Next Quarter
- Achieve Phase 1 completion
- Release v1.0.0 (if stable)

## 🔄 Revision History

- **2024-12-14**: Initial roadmap (overly optimistic)
- **2025-01-10**: Reality check - project not built yet
- **[Next Update]**: After first successful build
